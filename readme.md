# web component - standalone compiler

This is a test project aimed at bringing into a web component a minimal set of functionalities typical of a front-end framework (props, reactivity...)


## how to run it
It's plain vanillaJS, so you just need to clone the repo and use the Live Server plugin for VS Code to serve ```index.html``` from an HTTP server.
